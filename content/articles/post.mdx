# Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll set up a blog using Next.js, MDX, and Tailwind CSS. We'll start by creating a new Next.js project and then add MDX and Tailwind CSS to it. We'll also create a simple blog layout and add some sample blog posts.

# Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of JavaScript, React, and Next.js. You should also have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Step 1: Create a new Next.js project

First, let's create a new Next.js project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@12 my-(blog)
```

This will create a new Next.js project in a directory called `my-blog`. Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd my-(blog)
```

## Step 2: Install MDX

Next, let's install MDX and the necessary dependencies. Run the following command to install `@mdx-js/loader` and `@mdx-js/react`:

```bash
npm install @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react
```

## Step 3: Configure MDX

Next, we need to configure Next.js to support MDX. Create a new file called `next.config.js` in the root of your project and add the following code:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx']
}
```

This tells Next.js to treat `.mdx` files as pages.

## Step 4: Create a blog layout

Next, let's create a simple blog layout. Create a new file called `BlogLayout.js` in the `components` directory and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Link from 'next/link'

const BlogLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>
        <nav>
          <Link href="/">
            <a>Home</a>
          </Link>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  )
}

export default BlogLayout
```
