# Introduction

I've been interested in computers and networking for a long time. I've always kinda wanted to have something resembling homelab, before I even knew that this is an actual hobby thing. This is the story of my journey.

I started with a simple NAS on a Raspberry Pi 4. I used a 2x2TB Seagate Barracuda (these ones from 2012, noted to be one of the most failing drives ever made) and OpenMediaVault. It worked well, but I wanted to do more. I wanted to run VMs and containers, so I decided to build a proper server.
