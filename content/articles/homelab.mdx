description: My homelabbing journey and current setup
order: 2
---

I've been interested in computers and networking for a long time. I've always kinda wanted to have something resembling homelab, before I even knew that this was an actual thing.

Back in the day I had my files backup up to a D-Link NAS with 2 drive slots. Once that ancient machine started to show its age, I decided to build a simple NAS on a Raspberry Pi 4 with OpenMediaVault. I used 2x 3TB Seagate Barracuda hard drives (these from 2012, noted to be some of the most failing drives ever made). It worked well, but I wanted to do more. I got hooked on homelabbing, having tried running containers and selfhosting services. I wanted to run VMs and containers, so I decided to build a proper server. Then I got into advanced networking, enterprise software, clusters... and now here we are, with a full-blown homelab.. Damn.

## About homelabbing

Homelabbing is a hobby where people build and maintain their own "datacenters" at home. It's a great way to learn about networking, servers, and software. It's also a great way to run your own services, like a media server, game server or even a personal cloud storage array. You can also use it to test new software, experiment with different configurations, and learn new skills. Homelabbing allows you to get hands-on experience with real-world datacenter technology, without the pressure of a production environment *(unless your family members get upset when the media server goes down for maintenance again)*.

I'm not a professional sysadmin or anything, so I'm not doing anything too fancy. I'm just homelabbing to have fun and learn.

## Networking

For my networking needs I'm heavily using Ubiquiti gear. I have their router, an aggregation switch, a 48-port PoE switch, and a few APs and other gear. I quickly fell in love with their ecosystem after learning more about the Unifi product line, and knew this would be my future networking upgrade.

### Internet

My main connection is Starlink. I'm using it as my main connection, and I have a backup connection from a local ISP wirelessly. Starlink has been a huge upgrade for me and I love it so far. There is some limitations here and there, but I'm still yet to have fiber in my area, so that's the best I can get for now.

| Name | Type | Speed | Description | Notes |
|------|------| ----- | -------------| ----- |
| Starlink | Satellite | 350/75 Mbps | Main connection | Dynamic IP, CGNAT, DHCPv4, SLAAC /56 |
| OXYNET | Wireless | 8/4 Mbps (yup) | Backup connection | No IPv6, PPPoE |

### Networks

Second octet represents the VLAN ID, third octet is the unique server ID in the Homelab network.

| VLAN | ID | Subnet | Description | Notes |
|------|----|--------| ----------- | ----- |
| Default | 1 | 10.0.0.0/24 | Unifi devices | |
| Main | 10 | 10.10.0.0/24 | Main network | |
| Homelab | 20 | 10.20.0.0/20 | Homelab network | Third octet is the unique server ID |
| IoT | 30 | 10.30.0.0/24 | IoT devices | **No access to other VLANs** |
| Cameras | 40 | 10.40.0.0/24 | Security cameras | **No access to other VLANs** |
| Guest | 100 | 10.100.0.0/24 | Guest network | **Isolated**, speed limited |
| DMZ | 255 | 10.255.0.0/24 | DMZ network | **Isolated** |

### WiFi

All hotspots use 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz bands.

| SSID | Network | Description | Notes |
|------|---------| ----------- | ----- |
| Rancho | Main | Main network | |
| Rancho IoT | IoT | IoT network | Hidden |
| Rancho Guest | Guest | Guest network | Hotspot Portal |

| Band | Width | Channel |
|------|-------|---------|
| 2.4 GHz | 20 MHz | 1 |
| 5 GHz | 80 MHz | 40 |
| 6 GHz | 160 MHz | 37 |

### DNS

I'm using AdGuard Home as my main DNS server, which is blocking ads and trackers. It's running on my Raspberry Pi cluster, and it's providing me with DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS. It also caches DNS queries, so it's faster than using a public DNS server only. For my upstream DNS servers, I'm using Cloudflare and Quad9. I also utilize selective routing with OpenNIC for alternate, open TLDs.

### VPNs

My UDM SE is running Teleport by Unifi to provide me with a VPN connection to my home network. Additionally, I have Tailscale installed on all my devices to provide me with a secure connection to my servers.

## Servers

### Zeus

Zeus is my main server. It's running Proxmox, which is a hypervisor based on Debian. I'm running a few VMs and containers on it. Zeus is my primary machine for storage, running VMs and virtualized Kubernetes, as well as a testbed for new software I want to experiment with.
