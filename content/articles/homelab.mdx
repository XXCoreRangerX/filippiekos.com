I've been interested in computers and networking for a long time. I've always kinda wanted to have something resembling homelab, before I even knew that this is an actual hobby thing. This is the story of my journey.

I started with a simple NAS on a Raspberry Pi 4. I used a 2x2TB Seagate Barracuda (these from 2012, noted to be one of the most failing drives ever made) and OpenMediaVault. It worked well, but I wanted to do more. I wanted to run VMs and containers, so I decided to build a proper server.

## About homelabbing

Homelabbing is a hobby where people build and maintain their own datacenters at home. It's a great way to learn about networking, servers, and other IT stuff. It's also a great way to have a lot of fun and to have a lot of control over your data.

I'm not a professional sysadmin or anything, so I'm not doing anything too fancy. I'm just doing this for fun and to learn.

### My homelab

#### Apollo

Apollo is my main server. It's running Proxmox, which is a hypervisor based on Debian. I'm running a few VMs and containers on it.

**Software**

I'm running the following VMs and LXCs:

| Name                                | Type | Description                                                | Additional notes            |
|-------------------------------------|------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/) | VM   | Temporarily my NAS, to be replaced by a dedicated one      | SATA controller passthrough |
| [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/)   | VM   | Temporarily my router, to be replaced by a Ubiquiti router | 2-port NIC passthrough      |
| Debian with Docker                  | LXC  | For running various services                               | iGPU and QSV passthrough    |
| Windows 11                          | VM   | For remote gaming and other Windows-only stuff             | GPU passthrough             |

[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/) is my hypervisor of choice. It's based on Debian, and it's a great choice for homelabbing. Much less headache than Hyper-V or ESXi in my opinion.

[TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/) is my absolute go-to for NAS operating systems. I'm currently running it virtualized on Apollo, but I'm planning to build a dedicated machine for it soon. I'm passing through a SATA controller to it, so it has direct access to the hard drives.

[OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/) is *temporarily* my router. I'm planning to replace it with a Ubiquiti router once the UDM Pro Max comes out (hopefully soon). I'm passing through a 2-port NIC to it, so it has direct access to the network.

My Debian LXC is running Docker. I'm using it to run various services, like Jellyfin, Servarr stack, and other stuff.

#### Athena

Athena is my Raspberry Pi 4 8GB. It mainly serves as a reverse proxy, Pi-hole, and a monitoring server.
