# Introduction

Recently, I've discovered an entirely new hobby which, again, turned out into another rabbithole. This time, it's about audio. I've always been a music lover, but I never really cared about the quality of the sound. I was happy with my cheap earbuds and my laptop speakers. But then, I discovered the world of hi-fi audio, and I was hooked. I've spent countless hours researching and reading about headphones, DACs, amps, and all that jazz. I've also spent a lot of money on audio gear. I've bought and sold a lot of stuff, and I've finally settled on a setup that I'm happy with.

## Headphones

I've tried a lot of headphones, but I've finally settled on the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro (Black Edition 80 Ohm) as my main pair. They're open-back headphones, which means that they leak sound, but they also provide a more natural soundstage. They're also very comfortable, and they sound great.

## IEMs

I also have a pair of IEMs for when I'm on the go. I've tried the CCA CRA and the Salnotes Zero, but I've finally settled on the Salnotes Zero. They're very comfortable, and they sound great.

## DACs / Amps

The main DAC/Amp in my setup is the Qudelix 5K. It's a portable DAC/Amp that supports LDAC, aptX, and AAC. It also has a parametric EQ, which is great for fine-tuning the sound.

I use a Schiit Magni 3+ as a desktop amp. It's a great amp, and it pairs well with the DT 990 Pro.

For when I want to spice things up, I also have an Xduoo Mt-602 tube amp. It's a hybrid tube amp, and it adds a bit of warmth to the sound. I've tube-rolled it with some old, soviet, military-grade 6Å»1P-EW tubes, which despite being built in the 70s mainly for military purposes, sound much better than the stock 6J1 tubes.
