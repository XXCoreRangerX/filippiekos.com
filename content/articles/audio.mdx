Recently, I've discovered an entirely new hobby which, again, turned out to be another rabbithole. This time, it's about audio. I've always been a music lover, but I never really cared about the quality of the sound. I was happy with my cheap earbuds and my laptop speakers. But then, I discovered the world of hi-fi audio, and I was hooked. I've spent countless hours researching and reading about headphones, DACs, amps, and all that jazz. I've also spent a lot of money on audio gear. I've bought and sold a lot of stuff, and I've finally settled on a setup that I'm happy with.

## Headphones

I've tried a lot of headphones, but I've finally settled on the **Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro (Black Edition 80 Ohm)** as my main pair. They're open-back headphones, which means that they leak sound, but they also provide a more natural soundstage. They're also very comfortable, and they sound great.

## IEMs

I also have a pair of IEMs for when I'm on the go. I've tried the **CCA CRA** and the **Salnotes Zero**, but I've finally settled on the Salnotes Zero. They're very comfortable, and they sound great.

## DACs / Amps

The main DAC/Amp in my setup is the Qudelix 5K. It's a portable DAC/Amp that supports LDAC, aptX, and AAC. It also has a parametric EQ, which is great for fine-tuning the sound.

I use a Schiit Magni 3+ as a desktop amp. It's a great amp, and it pairs well with the DT 990 Pro.

For when I want to spice things up, I also have an xDuoo MT-602 tube amp. It's a hybrid tube amp, and it adds a bit of warmth to the sound. I've tube-rolled it with some old, soviet, military-grade 6Å»1P-EW tubes, which despite being built in the 70s mainly for military purposes, sound much better than the stock 6J1 tubes.
