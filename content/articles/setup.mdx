    My setup is constantly changing. I'm always trying out new gear and upgrading. Here's what I'm currently using.
</Callout>

My setup consists of a custom-built PC, a MacBook Pro, and various peripherals. I use my PC mainly for gaming and programming. My MacBook Pro is my daily driver for work and school. I also have a bunch of other tech that I use for different purposes.

## PC Build

This is my PC build. I built it in 2019, and it's still going strong. I use mostly for gaming and programming. Currently dual-booting Windows 10 and Arch Linux.

It's a little outdated, but it still gets the job done. I'm planning to upgrade soon though.

## Laptop

<Callout>I've recently upgraded from the **2021 base model MacBook Pro M1 Pro**.</Callout>

I have a 2023 MacBook Pro M3 Pro. I decided to go with the **12-core** variant of the **M3 Pro** SoC, along with **36GB of RAM** and **1TB of storage**. It's my daily driver for work and school. I use it for programming, writing, designing, video/photo editing, and more. The battery life is amazing and the performance is great.

I've been a PC user for most of my life, but I've been using Macs for the past few years for most of my productive work. The Apple Silicon truly brought Macs back to life. I love the build quality, the 120Hz MiniLED display, huge trackpad and that is is basically dead silent and barely warm to touch most of the time. I also use my MacBook for some media consumption and everyday tasks. Built-in speakers are also of really nice quality here. The MacBook DAC is plenty enough for most of my headphones and IEMs. Anyway, I'm still not a fan of macOS software limitations, but I've learned to live with them.

## Other tech

-   **Phone**: iPhone 14
-   **Tablet**: iPad 8th gen
-   **Watch**: Apple Watch SE 2022
-   **Console**: PS4 Pro
-   **TV box**: Apple TV 4K (2nd gen), Apple TV HD (3rd gen), Chromecast with Google TV
