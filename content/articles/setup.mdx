## Laptop

<Callout>I've recently upgraded from the **2021 base model MacBook Pro M1 Pro**.</Callout>

I have a 2023 MacBook Pro M3 Pro. I decided to go with the **12-core** variant of the **M3 Pro** SoC, along with **36GB of RAM** and **1TB of storage**. It's my daily driver for work and school. I use it for programming, writing, designing, video/photo editing, and more. The battery life is amazing and the performance is great.

I've been a PC user for most of my life, but I've been using Macs for the past few years for most of my productive work. The Apple Silicon truly brought Macs back to life. I love the build quality, the display, and the software. I also use it for some media consumption and everyday tasks.

## Other tech

-   **Phone**: iPhone 14
-   **Tablet**: iPad 9th gen
-   **Watch**: Apple Watch SE 2022
-   **Console**: PS4 Pro
-   **TV box**: Apple TV 4K (2nd gen)
