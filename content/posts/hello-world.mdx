<Callout>This portfolio is still a work in progress. I'm still working on adding more content and features. Stay tuned for more updates!</Callout>

# Introduction

This marks the first post on my blog. I've been wanting to start a blog for a while now, and I finally got around to it. Along with the entire portfolio website of course.

I have only very recently started to take web development seriously and beyond the basic HTML/CSS/JS or WordPress.

It is also the first time I've used Next.js, MDX, and Tailwind CSS. I've been wanting to try out these technologies for a while now. I'm really happy with the result, and I'm excited to share my experience with you.

# Tech Stack

## Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications. Overall, it's a great framework for building web applications, from small to large scale.

## Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without having to leave your HTML.

Ever since I started using Tailwind CSS, I've been loving it. It's a great framework for building web applications, and I'm really happy with the results. It's a great alternative to using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or writing custom CSS manually.

## MDX

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is a format that lets you write JSX in your Markdown documents. This means you can import and use React components in your Markdown files. This is great for writing blog posts, as you can use React components to embed code snippets, images, and more.

I'm using [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) to render MDX content in my Next.js application. With remark and rehype plugins, including [remarkGfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) and [rehype-highlight](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/tree/main/packages/rehype-highlight), I can render GitHub flavored Markdown and syntax highlight code blocks.

## shadcn/ui

I'm using the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) component library to build some of the UI of my blog. It's a great library that provides a lot of components out of the box, and it's really easy to use.

# Conclusion

I'm really happy with the result of my portfolio and blog. I'm excited to start writing more blog posts and sharing my experiences with you. I hope you enjoyed reading about how I built my portfolio and blog with Next.js, MDX, and Tailwind CSS.
